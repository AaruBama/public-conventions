### `CharField` choices

The values stored in the database should be uppercase and separated with
underscores. A human-readable version should also be added in the tuples
provided to the field.

```python
TELESALES, FIELD_SALES = "TELESALES", "FIELD_SALES"
CHANNEL_CHOICES = (
    (TELESALES, "Telesales"),
    (FIELD_SALES, "Field-sales"),
)
channel = models.CharField(max_length=128, choices=CHANNEL_CHOICES)
```

### Model field naming conventions

`DateTimeField`s should generally have suffix `_at`. For example:

- `created_at`
- `sent_at`
- `period_starts_at`

There are some exceptions such as `available_from` and `available_to`.


`DateField`s should have suffix `_date`:

- `billing_date`
- `supply_date`
